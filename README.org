This is a simple helper library for generating packages and storing
them in a common location, from there linking them to
=Pkg.dir(pkg_name)=. My use case is that I store my own packages that
are under development in directory that I synchronize between
different computers using [[https://syncthing.net][Syncthing]]. The steps necessary to achieve
this are automated using this package:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  using PkgHelp

  # Supports the same arguments as PkgDev.generate. Additionally, will
  # strip ".jl" from end of package name, as shown here.
  PkgHelp.generate("TestPackage.jl", "MIT")
#+END_SRC

  Moving /Users/stefanos/.julia/v0.5/TestPackage -> /Users/stefanos/programmering/julia/TestPackage.jl

#+END_example
=Input Julia pkg sync dir:= only has to be done once per machine. The
path entered is stored in =~/.julia/pkghelp.conf=.

This packages is also useful when setting up a new machine (make sure
only /packages/ are stored in =~/julia-sync= for this to work as
intended):
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output
  using PkgHelp

  for pkg in readdir(expanduser("~/julia-sync"))
      PkgHelp.link(pkg)
  end
#+END_SRC


NB. It is not very useful to sync packages that have binary
dependencies built in their =deps/= directory, since that will at
least be platform dependent, and maybe also host dependent. Use this
helper package for Julia-only packages.
